<h2>Windows</h2>

<p><span>
Windows 8 and 10 should find and install the correct drivers but Windows 7
users may need to manually install drivers using one of the links below.
Be sure to plug in your board board before installing the drivers.

</span></p>

<h2>Mac OS</h2>

<p><span>
On Mac OS, you'll need to use the open menu the first time you run MicroBlocks.
Right-click on MicroBlocks.app and select "Open" from the menu:
</span></p>

<p><span><img src="OpenMenu.png" width="350" alt="OpenMenu.png"></span></p>

<p><span>
Then click the "Open" button in the confirmation dialog:
</span></p>

<p><span><img src="OpenConfirmDialog.png" width="450" alt="OpenConfirmDialog.png"></span></p>

<p><span>
The dialog box will close. Now, double-click on MicrloBlocks.app to open it.
</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Note:</strong>You may need administrator access to do this.</span></p>

<h2>Linux</h2>

<p><span>
On Linux systems, users donâ€™t have access to the USB serial port by default.
To fix that, just add yourself to the "dialout" group by running this in a terminal:
<pre>
sudo usermod -G dialout -a `whoami`
</pre>
</span></p>

<p><span>
Log out and back in to make the change take effect.
You should see "dialout" when you list your groups.
</span></p>

<h2>Install MicroBlocks Firmware</h2>

<p><span>
<strong>Note:</strong>
This process is slightly different on Chromebooks; follow the on-screen instructions.
</span></p>

<p><span>
Start MicroBlocks, plug in your board, click the MicroBlocks menu (gear icon),
 and select "update firmware on board":
</span></p>

<p><span><img src="InstallMenu.png" width="300" alt="InstallMenu.png"></span></p>

<p><span>
<strong>Note:</strong>
If you have an Adafruit board such as the Circuit Playground Express
click the small boot button in the middle of the board twice quickly
to prepare the board before installing firmware.
The NeoPixel(s) on the board will turn green when the board is ready.
</span></p>

<p><span><img src="CPXinBootMode.jpg" width="400" alt="CPXinBootMode.jpg"></span></p>

<p><span>
It MicroBlocks cannot tell what kind of board is plugged in, it will present a menu:
</span></p>

<p><span><img src="BoardSelectionMenu.png" width="150" alt="BoardSelectionMenu.png"></span></p>

<p><span>
It takes five or ten seconds to install MicroBlocks.
When that's done, some boards unmount their USB drive, causing a notification to appear.
That's normal; you can just close the notification window.
</span></p>

<p><span>
Once the firmware is installed, the connection indicator should turn green:
</span></p>

<p><span><img src="Connected.png" alt="Connected.png"></span></p>

<p><span>
If it doesn't, try unplugging and the re-plugging the board.
As a quick test, click on the block:
</span></p>

<p><span><img src="SetUserLEDBlock.png" width="150" alt="SetUserLEDBlock.png"></span></p>

<p><span>
The user LED on your board should light up, showing that the board is connected.
You're ready to code!
</span></p>

<h2>Other Boards</h2>

<p><span>
MicroBlocks also runs on various other boards.
Firmware for ESP8266 (NodeMCU) and ESP32 boards can be installed directly from MicroBlocks.
