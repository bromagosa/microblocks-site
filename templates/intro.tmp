    MicroBlocks is a new programming language inspired by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a>
    that runs right inside microcontroller boards such as the
    <a href="https://microbit.org" target="_blank">micro:bit</a>,
    <a href="http://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html" target="_blank">NodeMCU</a>,
    <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333" target="_blank">AdaFruit Circuit Playground Express</a>,
    and many <a href="https://arduino.cc" target="_blank">Arduino</a> boards.

        <h2>Live</h2>
        <span>
            MicroBlocks is a live environment. Click on a block and it runs immediately, right on the board.
            Explore light, sound, and other action commands. See or graph sensor values in real time.
            No more waiting for your code to compile and download.

        <span>
            Want to play some music while animating a string of colorful LEDs? No problem!
            MicroBlocks lets you write separate scripts for each task and run them
            at the same time. Your code is simpler to write and easier to understand.

        <h2>Portable</h2>
        <span>
            MicroBlocks runs on many different boards, but your scripts are portable.
            Buttons, sensors, and display blocks behave the same on all boards with the required hardware.
            MicroBlocks even simulates the micro:bit 5x5 LED display on TFT displays.

        <span>
            When you like what your program does, just unplug the board, connect a battery,
            and you're good to go. Make a pocket game, fitness app, or light-up costume that
            goes wherever you do.

        <span>
            With MicroBlocks, the board acts like a memory stick.
            No need for files; just plug in a board and the scripts reappear.
            Hand your board to a friend so they can explore your code.
            They might even add a cool new feature!

<h1 id="intro">What is it about?</h1>
<p><span>
    The MicroBlocks system allows for dynamic, parallel and interactive programming, just like in Scratch, but with the twist of letting your projects run autonomously inside the board without being tethered to a computer. Thus, MicroBlocks provides the immediacy and liveness of tethered blocks programming, while supporting real-world applications that require precision timing, autonomous operation, or physically embedding the processor into projects. For example, one might write a program to record acceleration data, then embed the microcontroller and a small battery in a model rocket to explore G-forces at launch time.
</span></p>
<p><span>
    In other words, MicroBlocks lets you program your boards exactly like you would in <a href="http://snap4arduino.rocks" target="_blank">Snap4Arduino</a>, <a href="http://s4a.cat" target="_blank">S4A</a> or the <a href="https://khanning.github.io/scratch-arduino-extension/" target="_blank">Arduino extension</a> for Scratch, and when you are happy with your program you can just unplug the board from your computer and everything will keep running as if by magic!
</span></p>
<p><span>
    With MicroBlocks, you can build your own "real world" digital instruments, interactive jewelry, electronic games and measuring devices, all by using blocks.

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p><span>
Visit the <a href="download">Download</a> page to download the MicroBlocks app
for Windows, MacOS, Linux, or Raspberry Pi.
If you have a Chromebook, you can get the
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/microblocks/cbmcbhgijipgdmlnieolilhghfmnngbb">Chromebook App</a>.
</span></p>

<p><span>
You can also
<a href="https://microblocks.fun/run/microblocks.html">run MicroBlocks in a Chrome or Edge browser</a>
without installing anything.
To allow MicroBlocks to connect to your board,
you'll need visit the "chrome://flags" page and enable the "Experimental Web Platform features" flag.
