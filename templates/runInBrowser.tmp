<h1>Running MicroBlocks in the Browser</h1>

<p><span>
MicroBlocks runs in Chrome and recent Microsoft Edge browsers.
That can be helpful in school, library, and other settings
where it is difficult to install application programs.
</span></p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p><span>
To communicate with the microcontroller, MicroBlocks uses a brand new browser
feature called "WebSerial." Eventually, that feature will be available
by default but, for now, it must be enabled manually.
</span></p>

<p><span>
Enter "chrome://flags" in the nav bar of the browser:
</span></p>

<p><span>

</span></p>

<p><span>
There are many flags. The quickest way to find the right one is to type "experimental web"
into the flags search bar, then enable
"Experimental Web Platform features":

<h2>Run MicroBlocks</h2>

<p><span>
Click the green button at the top of this page to run MicroBlocks.
</span></p>

<h2>Install Firmware</h2>

<p><span>
The first time you use MicroBlocks on a new board you must install the MicroBlocks firmware.
Select "update firmware on board" from the MicroBlocks (gear) menu and follow the prompts.
</span></p>

<h2>Connect</h2>

<p><span>
Connect your microcontroller to the computer with a USB cable, then click on the USB icon.
That will bring up a dialog box listing the available serial ports.
On some platforms, you may see your microcontroller listed twice; either one will work.
</span></p>

<p><span>
If the browser connects successfully, a green circle will appear behind the USB icon:

</span></p>

<h2>Working with Projects</h2>

<p><span>
Use the file menu to save and open files:
</span></p>

</span></p>

<p><span>
In the File Open dialog, the computer button will allow you to navigate
to the file you saved. You can also open a MicroBlocks file by dropping it
onto the MicroBlocks browser window:
