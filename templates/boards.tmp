MicroBlocks runs on a wide variety of microcontroller boards.
This page highlights some that are especially useful for learners and educators.

<h2><a href="http://microbit.org">BBC micro:bit</a> ($15-$18)</h2>

<p><span><img src="boards/microbit.png" width="400"></span></p>

<span><p>
The micro:bit is the most popular board for education by far.
Over four million micro:bits have been distributed in over sixty countries
<a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/3/243028-the-bbc-microbit-from-the-u-k-to-the-world/fulltext">ACM 2020</a>
and the micro:bit Educational Foundation reports that over twenty million
students have used micro:bits.
</p></span>

<span><p>
The micro:bit has a rich set of features, including
two buttons, a 5x5 LED array that can display graphics and text,
a radio that supports peer-to-peer messaging, and sensors
for light, motion, and temperature. The micro:bit also has an edge
connector that allows additional devices to be connected if desired,
but adding components is not necessary. The many built in features
of the micro:bit allow beginners to do interesting things immediately
without wiring. That simplicity allows the micro:bit to be used
by elementary school children (grades 3-5) as well as teens and adults.
As Seymour Papert might say, the micro:bit has a low floor and a high ceiling.

<h2><a href="https://calliope.cc/calliope-mini/uebersicht">Calliope mini</a> ($50)</h2>

<p><span><img src="boards/calliope.png" width="450"></span></p>

<span><p>
The Calliope mini is a German variant of the micro:bit, with a few
changes and extensions. The most obvious change is that shape of the
board, which was optimized for use with alligator clips. The Calliope
mini also has a built-in speaker, a microphone, and an RGB LED.
While it lacks the micro:bit's edge connector, it has pins for
controlling two motors plus two Grove connectors for connecting
additional components.
</p></span>

<span><p>
In the US, the Calliope mini is available from
<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4071">AdaFruit</a>.

</p></span>

<h2><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333">Circuit Playground Express</a> and <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4333">Circuit Playground Bluefruit</a> ($25)</h2>

<p><span><img src="boards/cpx.png" width="550"></span></p>

<span><p>
The AdaFruit Circuit Playground Express and Circuit Playground Bluefruit are
also popular with educators. These boards feature a set of buttons and
sensors similar to those of the micro:bit, but replace the 5x5 LED
display with a circle of 10 programmable RGB LED "NeoPixels"
than can be used to create colorful, eye-catching animations.
These boards also have good built-in speakers and eight alligator-clip
friendly GPIO pins. Less obviously, these boards have beefy power
supplies that can drive multiple external devices such as servo motors
or NeoPixels strips making them especially useful in art projects.
</p></span>

<span><p>
The Circuit Playground Bluefruit (but not the Express) has a radio
that can communicate with the micro:bit and Calliope mini.

<h2><a href="https://market.citilab.eu/ca/producte/placa-ed1/">Citilab ED1</a> (€38.50)</h2>

<p><span><img src="boards/ed1.png" width="450"></span></p>

<span><p>
The ED1 board and the related
<a href="https://market.citilab.eu/ca/producte/kit-robotica-ed1/">robot kit</a>
were developed by the Citilab Cornellà EduLab specifically for K-12 education.
EduLab has led workshops for thousands of school children in the Barcelona area
using MicroBlocks on the ED1.
Over the past several years, the ED1 board and robot kit have gone through
multiple design-and-test cycles, and it shows.
Their robot uses stepper motors (the motor controller is built into
the board) for precision.
As a result, it can turn and move by exact amounts and,
when dragging a pen, is capable of drawing geometric figures accurately.
</p></span>

<span><p>
The ED1 has a 128x128 TFT display that can be used to display
text and graphics. There is even a Logo Turtle library for it. The display
can simulate the micro:bit's 5x5 LED display, so the ED1 can run
micro:bit programs. The board includes a nice built-in speaker,
six touch buttons, motion, light, and temperature sensors, an
IR receiver, and a set of GPIO pins for connecting additional devices.

</p></span>

<span><p>
Finally, the ED1 supports WiFi. Using MicroBlocks libraries, you can
create a small HTTP server that you can use to remotely control the
ED1 from a web browser or from a <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/">Snap!</a>
program.
</p></span>

<h2><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4500">AdaFruit Clue</a> ($40)</h2>

<p><span><img src="boards/clue.png" width="400"></span></p>

<span><p>
The Clue, a new board from AdaFruit, was recently featured on the
cover of Make: magazine. Like the ED1, it has a TFT display (240x240)
and speaker. It also has an impressive collection of built in sensors
(motion, magnetometer, proximity/light/color/gesture,
sound, humidity, temperature, and barometric pressure/altitude)
and features a radio that can interoperate with the micro:bit.
However, the most unique feature of the Clue is that it has an
edge connector that is compatible with the micro:bit edge
connector, so it can take advantage of the extension board ecosystem
created for the micro:bit.

<h2><a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/grey-development-core?variant=16804796006490">M5Stack Grey</a> ($34)</h2>

<p><span><img src="boards/m5stack.png" width="400"></span></p>

<span><p>
M5Stack products feature plastic cases that make them look more like
consumer products than most microcontroller boards. The M5Stack Grey
features a large TFT display (320x240), three buttons, motion sensor,
speaker, WiFi, and a built-in rechargeable battery.
A set of GPIO pins are accessible through slots in the sides of the unit.
The M5Stack Basic Core model is similar to the Grey model but omits the motion sensor.
</p></span>

<h2><a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/stick-c">M5 Stick-C</a> ($10)</h2>

<p><span><img src="boards/m5stickC.png" width="450"></span></p>

<span><p>
The M5 Stick-C features a tiny TFT display (160x80), a motion sensor,
two buttons, an IR transmitter, WiFi, and a small rechargeable
battery. Small and light, the M5Stick-C can be worn on the wrist and
used to create your own fitness device or smart watch.
</p></span>

<h2><a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/atom-matrix-esp32-development-kit">M5 Atom Matrix</a> ($10)</h2>

<p><span><img src="boards/m5atomMatrix.png" width="450"></span></p>

<span><p>
The M5 Atom Matrix is tiny -- only one inch (24 mm) square! Instead of
a TFT display, it has a 5x5 grid of programmable RGB LED's and the
entire top is a button (but that's the only button). It has a built-in
motion sensor, an IR transmitter, and WiFi, but it does not have a
built-in battery.
</p></span>

<h2>ESP8266 ($4) and ESP32 ($8)</h2>

<p><span><img src="boards/espboards.png" width="450"></span></p>

<span><p>
Created by the Chinese company Espressif, the ESP8266 and ESP32 are WiFi-enabled
microcontroller modules that are used most of the WiFi-capable boards
that MicroBlocks supports.
Those modules are also available in inexpensive bare-bones boards designed
for electronics hobbyists such as the NodeMCU and Wemos d1 mini. Such
boards don't have much built in -- at most a single programmable
button and one or two LED's. They are designed to be plugged into an
electronics prototyping board and connected to additional components.
Since some wiring is required to make these boards do interesting things,
they have a steeper learning curve for beginners than the other boards
listed here.
</p></span>

<span><p>
However, their low cost and WiFi capabilities makes these boards useful
for advanced students or makers who want to explore IoT applications.
These boards can be found on Amazon and are often cheaper if you buy multiple boards.
It's a good idea to check the reviews before buying one of these boards. Some
boards are too wide to be conveniently used in electronic prototyping boards
and some super-cheap boards from Chinese mail order companies lack USB-serial chips.
</p></span>

<h2>Other Boards</h2>

<span><p>
In addition to the boards listed here, MicroBlocks runs on
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/john_maloney/smallvm/wiki/Devices">many other boards</a>.
