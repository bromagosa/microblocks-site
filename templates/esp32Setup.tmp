<h1 id="ESP32">ESP32 Setup</h1>

<p><span>These notes are for users who want to work with MicroBlocks on
ESP32 boards and are comfortable with the extra technical challenges involved.</span></p>

<h2>The ESP32</h2>

<p><span>The <a href="http://esp32.net">ESP32</a> from Espressif Systems
combines a 32-bit dual-core processor with WiFi and Bluetooth functionality
and a set of IO pins.
Basic ESP32 boards don't have many built in capabilities (just a user LED) so
most interesting applications require connecting external components.
The need for wiring makes basic ESP32 boards less appropriate for younger children
and beginners than boards with more built-in features.
</span></p>

<h2>Serial Setup</h3>

<p><span>On some systems, you may need to install a serial driver.
Depending on the USB-serial chip on your board you may need either
<a href="https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit/tree/master/Drivers">CH340G driver</a> or
<a href="https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers">Silcon Labs CP210x driver</a>.
</span></p>

<p><span>On Linux, add yourself to the "dialout" group by running this in a terminal:
<pre>
sudo usermod -G dialout -a `whoami`
</pre>
</span></p>

<h2>Installing MicroBlocks Firmware</h2>

<p><span>
<strong>Chromebook note</strong>: Currently, it is
not possible install the MicroBlocks firmware on ESP32 boards from a Chromebook.
However, a Windows, Mac, or Linux laptop can be used to install the MicroBlocks firmware,
and then the board can be used with MicroBlocks on Chromebooks.
</span></p>

<p><span>
To install the MicroBlocks firmware on an ESP32 board, launch MicroBlocks and plug in the board.
From the MicroBlocks (gear) menu, select "install firmware on board":
</span></p>

<p><span><img src="UpdateFirmware.png" width="250"></span></p>

<p><span>
Then select "ESP32":
</span></p>

<p><span><img src="selectESP32.png" width="200"></span></p>

<p><span>
As the firmware loads, you will see a progress screen:
</span></p>

<p><span><img src="espFlashing.png" width="400"></span></p>

<p><span>
Once the firmware is installed, a green circle should appear to show that the board is connected.
</span></p>

<p><span><img src="Connected.png" width="50"></span></p>

<p><span>
That may take a few seconds. In rare cases you may need to disconnect and reconnect the board.
</span></p>

<p><span>To verify that everything is working, try the following:</span></p>

<p><span><img src="SetUserLEDBlock.png" width="150" alt="SetUserLEDBlock.png"></span></p>

<p><span>The user LED on your board should light up, showing that the board is connected.
You're ready to code!</span></p>
